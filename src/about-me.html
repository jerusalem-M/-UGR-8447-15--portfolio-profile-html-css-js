            <p class="about-description">I am a third-year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Institution Of Technology University, deeply passionate about using technology to create meaningful change. My dream is to leave a lasting mark, turning ideas into solutions that can make a difference. But beyond academics, I have a strong connection to nature. Green is my favorite color because it reminds me of earth, balance, and life itself. I also love soft yellow and orange for the warmth and positivity it brings.

                I have an unstoppable urge to learn and explore. From the vastness of astronomy and the logic of physics to the stories of history and the myths of ancient Greece, I find inspiration everywhere. This curiosity drives me to see the world differently and fuels my belief that creativity is limitless.
                
                For me, coding is more than just a skill; it’s an art form. It’s a way to express my thoughts and ideas, turning them into something tangible and impactful. Every line of code feels like a brushstroke on a canvas, helping me create solutions that blend imagination and reality. Through learning, curiosity, and creativity, I aim to bring my vision to life and share it with the world.</p>

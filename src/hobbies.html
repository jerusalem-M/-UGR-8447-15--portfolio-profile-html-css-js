            <p id="hobbies-intro">Art, in its essence, is the purest expression of human emotion and creativity. It speaks<br> to the heart, transcends words, and leaves a piece of the creator in every stroke, note,<br> or story. I believe hobbies, in their subtle ways, are reflections of art. They are the quiet<br> acts of creation, connection, and discovery that shape who we are.<br><br>
                As Albert Camus once said, <q>The literal meaning of life is whatever youâ€™re doing that<br> prevents you from killing yourself.</q> To me, hobbies embody this meaning. They are the<br> anchor in the chaos, the spark of joy that keeps us going. Whether itâ€™s getting lost in<br> the world of movies, feeling the rhythm of music, savoring the process of cooking, or<br> finding new perspectives in books, hobbies are more than pastimesâ€”they are lifelines.<br> They remind us of the beauty in living, the art in existing, and the profound desire to<br> keep seeking, dreaming, and creating.</p>

                My hobbies reflect the things that bring me joy and keep me curious:  
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Movies:</strong>Watching movies is my escape to a world of stories. I love almost all Christopher Nolan movies, the Harry Potter series, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Music:</strong> I listen to any genre that speaks to my soulâ€”from the depth of reggae to the coldness of jazz and blues, the soothing tones of indie, the madness of rock, the<br> calmness of Malian songs, to classic and fusion Amharic music.</li>
                    <li><strong>Books:</strong> I love reading books that transport me to different worlds or offer new perspectives. John Greenâ€™s books are my absolute favorites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Well i guess, experimenting with flavors and ingredients is a really fun thing to do.</li>
                </ul>

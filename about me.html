            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="about-description">I am a third-year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Institution Of Technology University, deeply passionate about using<br> technology to create meaningful change. My dream is to leave a lasting mark, turning<br> ideas into solutions that can make a difference. But beyond academics, I have a strong<br> connection to nature. Green is my favorite color because it reminds me of earth,<br> balance, and life itself. I also love soft yellow and orange for the warmth and positivity it brings.<br> <br>

                I have an unstoppable urge to learn and explore. From the vastness of astronomy and<br> the logic of physics to the stories of history and the myths of ancient Greece, I find<br> inspiration everywhere. This curiosity drives me to see the world differently and fuels<br> my belief that creativity is limitless.<br><br>
                
                For me, coding is more than just a skill; itâ€™s an art form. Itâ€™s a way to express my<br> thoughts and ideas, turning them into something tangible and impactful. Every<br> line of code feels like a brushstroke on a canvas, helping me create solutions that blend<br> imagination and reality. Through learning, curiosity, and creativity, I aim to bring my<br> vision to life and share it with the world.</p>
